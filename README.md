## Installation 

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command: 

``` 
npm i 
``` 

## Usage 

This application is free to use by anyone. 

To start off, run ```npm i```in your command line to make sure all dependencies are installed. Then run ```node index.js``` to start the application. 

The terminal/command line tool will then prompt you to answer multiple questions. Most question will ask for a text input, while the question regarding licenses will be a select. For the selection, simple navigating with your up and down arrow keys and press enter. Additionally, some input fields have default values. Simply press enter without entering anything, and the default value would be applied. 

Once you finish anwering all the question prompts, a "README.md" file will be generated in your working directory.
